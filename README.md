# Automated-Form-Processing
Automated Form Processing is an Image Processing based Project which is used to extract information from the Given Form.The format of the form was fixed.There were some fields were input expected was Optical Character and some fields were expected input was  Handwritten Character.

Used OpenCV library of python to perform Image Processing related tasks like Binarization,Smoothening,Skew Correction etc.

To detect rows and columns in a graph we used the Histogram Analysis based method.Horizontal and Vertical Profiling was done for the Image to detect rows and columns in the Image

We have used the pytesseract library of python to perform OCR in OCR related form fields.

A Convolutional Neural Network model was build using keras library for handwritten Digit Recognition.     

# Command to run the project
```python main.py```
